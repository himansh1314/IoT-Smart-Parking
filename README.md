# IoT-Smart-Parking
IoT smart car parking system which looks for vacant slots in a parking lot and updates the status of slots in a database, accessible via android app 
Here, FireBase has been used as the database for storing the status of parking slots. Firebase is a NoSQL database. This is only a demonstration
of the concept. To check for vacant slots, we used IR Sensor although it is not really preferred as it can detect just about anything.
      1. For demonstration purposes we decided to make app for only 4 parking slots.
      2. App was initially made on MIT App Inventor, but we have also started working on making a full fledged app on Android Studio.
      3. The micrcontroller used here was NodeMCU, which has a built in WiFi module, i.e. esp8266.
      4. This makes it really easy to develop IoT products.
